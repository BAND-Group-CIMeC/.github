:loudspeaker: The Brain Asymmetry & Neurodevelopmental Disease (BAND) group investigates zebrafish as an animal model to study neurodevelopmental disorders such as Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) and other syndromes linked to Autism.

:pushpin: The BAND group investigates how the alteration of brain asymmetry can contribute to cognitive and social impairments associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) and 7qDuplication Syndrome (7qDupl). 

:microscope: Using zebrafish as animal model, we study the effects of single gene mutations linked to these syndromes, focusing on how alterations in hemispheric specialization influence sociability and other cognitive functions (e.g., anxiety and numerical abilities).
